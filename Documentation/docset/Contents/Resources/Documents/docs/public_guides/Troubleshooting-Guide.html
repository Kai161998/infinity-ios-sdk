					<p>After setting up tracking in your app, there are several methods that you can use to help monitor collection of event data, or to troubleshoot anomalies in the data stream. The following list is a set of options that may help you troubleshoot at various stages of your development process, and are recommendations by Webtrends. Naturally there are other software than the recommended if your organization is familiar with something else, these are just the tools we are most familiar with:</p>

<ol>
<li>Turn <strong>wt_dc_debug</strong> on. The default is on, so just donâ€™t turn it off. This sends lots of information to the log within the IDE (Xcode). Every time an event is sent to the server, we display it in the log. You can see exactly what data is being sent.</li>
<li>Use <strong>Fiddler</strong> to monitor events: <a href="https://forums.webtrends.com/webtrends/topics/sdk-testing-and-debugging" title="Testing and Debugging Forums">See the Webtrends support forums</a> for more details.</li>
<li><p>Set up <strong>Charles Proxy</strong>. <a href="https://www.charlesproxy.com/" title="Charles">Charles</a> is a $40 OS X software package similar to <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/" title="Wireshark">Wireshark</a> or <a href="http://www.telerik.com/fiddler" title="Fiddler">Fiddler</a>. With it, you can inspect http requests and responses, looking exactly at what each contain. This only works if the app is configured to send via HTTP. If the default HTTPS is used, the data is encrypted. For testing, configure the app to hit our servers via HTTP. Charles can also be configured to stand in as a proxy server for a physical device, not just for simulators.</p>

<p> <strong>Note:</strong> To use HTTP (as opposed to HTTPS) in an iOS app, you must configure your Xcode target&rsquo;s <em>App Transport Security Settings</em> to <strong>Allow Arbitrary Loads=YES</strong>. This can be changed by editing the info.plist file or setting it in the Xcode UI project settings.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also set up <strong>Webtrends Streams&trade;</strong> to watch events come through. If you have access to Webtrends Streams&trade;, you can watch as events come through in real time and are processed by the Webtrends data collection network. This can help you monitor the end result of collection tests on your SDK.</p></li>
</ol>
