					<p>The sample applications that ship with the Analytics and Optimize SDKs are designed to give you, the developer, real-world examples of how to use the libraries.</p>

<p>There are two sample applications, both identical in functionality. To demonstrate how to use the SDK in your application, we have written the sample app in both Objective C and Swift. The app shows off how to use both the Analytics and Optimize parts of the SDK, as well as how to use an Apple Watch with your app.</p>

<h1>Setting Up the Sample App</h1>

<p>The sample applications can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/Webtrends/mobile-sdk-sample-apps" title="Sample App Github Repo">Webtrends Mobile SDK Github repository</a>. Within this repo you will find the iOSSampleApps folder, which contains both versions of the app.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong><em>Download the application</em></strong> to your local system. You don&rsquo;t need the entire repo, but you may clone it to get the content you need.</li>
<li><strong><em>Ensure you have Cocoapods installed</em></strong> on your system. For more information on installing and using Cocoapods, see the <a href="Core-SDK---Getting-Started-Guide.html" title="Getting Started Guide">Getting Started Guide</a> for details.</li>
<li><strong><em>Install the SDK</em></strong> by running <code>pod install</code> from a terminal window in the application of your choice (Swift or Objective C).</li>
<li><strong><em>Open the .xcworkspace file</em></strong> file (<em>not</em> the SwiftSample.xcodeproj file). This file is created when the cocoapod is installed.</li>
<li><strong><em>Compile and run</em></strong> the app on a simulator or a physical device. Choose the ObjSample or SwiftSample target and select a simulator.</li>
</ol>


<h1>A Walkthrough of the App</h1>

<p>Open the application and click the <strong><em>Sign In</em></strong> button. It is not necessary to use a login ID or password. These fields are just dummies.</p>

<p><img src="images/sampleApp1.png" width="50%"></p>

<p>This is the main menu page. From here, you can navigate to anywhere in the app using the buttons on the main view or the tab bar buttons along the bottom. Click the <strong><em>Transactions</em></strong> button.</p>

<p><img src="images/sampleApp2.png" width="50%"></p>

<p>Here you can type something in the search bar and tap enter. This will trigger a dummy search method. The method does not actually search for anything, but it does trigger a popup to indicate that a search event has occurred. The search method makes a call to the SDK to trigger a new Analytics search event.</p>

<p><img src="images/sampleAppSearch1.png" width="50%"><img src="images/sampleAppSearch2.png" width="50%">
Peeking at the code in the TransactionsViewController class shows exactly what is going on here:</p>

<pre><code>func searchBarSearchButtonClicked(searchBar: UISearchBar) {
    // Create an event for our product view
    // Start by creating a meta object containing basic information about the event
    // eventPath can be nil if you want to use the default eventPath.
    // customParams are an optional dictionary containing string keys and string values.
    let meta = WTEventMeta(eventPath: nil, description: "user triggered search", type: "tap", customParams: nil)

    WTDataCollector.sharedCollector().triggerEventForSearchPhrase(searchBar.text, searchResult: "Search result", eventMeta: meta)

    self.view.endEditing(false)
    let alert = UIAlertView(title: "Search Event Triggered", message: "Search event has been added to data collector", delegate: nil, cancelButtonTitle: "OK")
    alert.show()
}
</code></pre>

<p>This event will show up in Analytics reporting as a SearchPhrase event containing the parameters above.</p>

<p>Next, open the <strong>Products</strong> tab, either by navigating back to Home or by clicking on the Products tab on the tab bar. This view shows three images and three buttons. By clicking on any one of the buttons, you will trigger another event, this time for a ProductId event. The relevant code (from the ProductViewController class) is shown below:</p>

<pre><code>    let meta = WTEventMeta(eventPath: "/bank/products", description: "user tapped card product", type: "tap", customParams: ["myCustomParam":"myCustomValue"])

    // Once we've set up our basic information, pass it to the data collector
    WTDataCollector.sharedCollector().triggerEventForProductId(cardString, productSku: cardSku, contentGroup: "Logged In", eventMeta: meta)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="images/sampleAppProducts1.png" width="50%"><img src="images/sampleAppProducts2.png" width="50%"></p>

<p>The <strong>Invest</strong> tab item takes you to a page containing a UIWebView that pulls content from a web site. This is a demonstration of the hybrid (mixing native iOS and web browser) functionality of the SDK. Session information that is started in the native app can be continued onto an Analytics-equipped web page and vice versa. This makes reporting on an end user very easy, since the session remains consistent from app to web.</p>

<p>The <strong>Visit Our Web Site</strong> link also demonstrates hybrid functionality, but shows how a session can continue into a native Safari session and vice versa.</p>

<p><img src="images/sampleAppInvest.png" width="50%"><img src="images/sampleAppVisitWebsite.png" width="50%"></p>

<p>Next, the <strong>Settings</strong> tab takes you to a page that controls a few aspects of the SDK itself. The buttons set configuration settings in the SDK that affect its behavior. Each of these buttons toggles a boolean setting on or off. The specific call to the SDK looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>let enabled = WTDataCollector.sharedCollector().valueForConfigKey(settingName) as! Bool
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>settingName</strong> string is set in the Story Board and passed into this class at runtime.</p>

<p><img src="images/sampleAppSettings.png" width="50%"></p>

<p>Finally, the <strong>About Us</strong> page is designed to show off the features of using Optimize&trade; in your application. The images below show the page rendered after applying several Optimize&trade; tests to the UI elements on the page (left) and the design view in the storyboard in Xcode, which shows the default UI elements (right). As you can see, the background color has been changed as well as the text fields and buttons. This change is done live when the SDK initializes and is rendered when the user navigates to this page.</p>

<p>Each of these UI elements are Webtrends SDK-specific subclasses of standard Cocoa Touch classes. For example, the text field that contains &ldquo;Optimized Text Field&rdquo; is a WTOptimizeTextField subclass of UITextField. Using this subclass and setting the WtIdentifier property enables it to be a target of an Optimize test.</p>

<p><img src="images/sampleAppAboutUs1.png" width="50%"><img src="images/SampleAppAboutUsDesignView.png" width="50%" align="top"></p>

<p>Clicking on the Greet button at the top demonstrates the use of a live in-the-moment (non-cached) Optimize test. Unlike normal cached tests, the content of the test is not downloaded ahead of time. When the user clicks one of the greetings, the SDK calls home to the Optimize&trade; server, sending along some data, downloads content returned to it based on that data, and displays the results. In the case of the greeting, the app sends <code>greeting=personal</code> or <code>greeting=generic</code>. The Optimize server has a rule that responds to the value of <strong>greeting</strong> and returns some customized text.</p>

<p><img src="images/sampleAppGreet.png" width="50%"><img src="images/sampleAppGreetPersonal.png" width="50%"></p>

<p>Clicking on <strong>Show Optimize Examples</strong> takes you to a sample page full of optimized UI elements. This page demonstrates some of the functionality available when using Optimize&trade; in an iOS application. If you open the application storyboard and look at this view, you will notice that the top and bottom UI elements are styled exactly the same. When rendered at runtime, the tests downloaded from the Optimize&trade; server are applied, changing fonts, colors, background colors, etc. For more information about customizing the UI or affecting app behavior using Optimize, see the <a href="Optimize---Factor-JSON-Formatting-Guide.html" title="JSON Formatting Guide">Factor JSON Formatting Guide</a> document.</p>

<h1>Next Steps</h1>

<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve seen some of the things that are possible with the Webtrends iOS SDK for Analytics and Optimize&trade;, feel free to poke around the source code to see how it all works. We encourage you to experiment with the code and try new things. The SDK is very powerful, but also very simple to use. Go have some fun with it.</p>

<p>You may also want to explore using the Apple Watch extension for the SDK. For more information on that, please see the <a href="Analytics---Webtrends-WatchKit-SDK-Guide.html" title="Watch Kit Extension Guide">WatchKit SDK Guide</a>.</p>
